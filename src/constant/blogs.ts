      "# Deploying a Production ready React-Express app on AWS\n\nIn this tutorial, I will be going over to how to deploy a Javascript app from start to finish using AWS and EC2. Recently, my partner [Tu](https://github.com/tuvo1106) and I launched our app AlgoAcademy (a resource for reviewing algorithms and data structures) and we wanted to share with other developers some of the lessons we learned along the way.\n\nFollowing this tutorial, you will have an application that has:\n\n- A React frontend, Express backend\n- An AWS EC2 server configured to host your application\n- SSL-certification with Certbot\n- A custom domain name\n- Continuous deployment with Github Actions/SSM Agent\n\n\tWe have provided a dummy repo to follow along with [here](https://github.com/rmiyazaki6499/mern-app.git), but feel free to apply it to your own application as necessary.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n  - [Project Layout](#project-layout)\n  - [Previewing the Project](#previewing-the-project)\n  - [Previewing the Mern-app project with Docker](#previewing-the-mern-app-project-with-docker)\n\t- [Install Docker](#install-docker)\n\t- [Cleaning up the Container and Image](#cleaning-up-the-container-and-image)\n  - [Previewing the Mern-app project Locally](#previewing-the-mern-app-project-locally)\n  - [Creating an AWS Account](#creating-an-aws-account)\n  - [Creating an AWS EC2 Instance](#creating-an-aws-ec2-instance)\n\t- [EC2 Console](#ec2-console)\n\t- [AMI](#ami)\n\t- [Security Groups](#security-groups)\n\t- [Instance Details](#instance-details)\n\t- [Key Pairs](#key-pairs)\n\t- [Elastic IP](#elastic-ip)\n\t- [Connecting to your EC2 Instance](#connecting-to-your-ec2-instance)\n  - [EC2 Environment Setup](#ec2-environment-setup)\n\t- [Setting up the Project on the Remote Server](#setting-up-the-project-on-the-remote-server)\n\t- [Starting PM2](#starting-pm2)\n\t- [Configuring NGINX](#configuring-nginx)\n  - [Setting up Continuous Deployment](#setting-up-continuous-deployment)\n\t- [Github Actions](#github-actions)\n\t- [Create SSM Role](#create-ssm-role)\n\t- [Assigning SSM Role to EC2 Instance](#assigning-ssm-role-to-ec2-instance)\n\t- [Github Secrets](#github-secrets)\n\t- [Deployment Script](#deployment-script)\n\t- [YAML File](#yaml-file)\n\t- [Issues with Github Actions](#issues-with-github-actions)\n  - [Setting up your Domain](#setting-up-your-domain)\n\t- [Creating Domain records](#creating-domain-records)\n\t- [Configuring our Web Server](#configuring-our-web-server)\n  - [HTTPS](#https)\n\t- [Installing Certbot](#installing-certbot)\n  - [Closing Thoughts](#closing-thoughts)\n\n\t  ---\n\n## Project Layout\n\nHere is the project layout:\n\n```\nmern-app\n|__ client/ (React App Frontend)\n|  |__ public/\n|  |__ src/\n|__ scripts/\n|__ app.js (Express Backend)\n|__ package.json\n|__ Dockerfile\n|__ docker-compose.yml\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### Previewing the Project\n\nStart by cloning the project with the command:\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/rmiyazaki6499/mern-app.git\n```\n\n## Previewing the `mern-app` project with Docker\n\n### Install Docker\n\nTo make this as easy as possible, we will be using *Docker Compose* to creat our container.\n\n  - If you do not have Docker yet, start by downloading it if you are on a Mac or Windows:\n\t  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop\n\n  - Or if you are on a Linux Distribution follow the directions here:\n\t  https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/\n\n  - To confirm you have Docker Compose, open up your terminal and run the command below:\n\n\t  ```\n\t  $ docker-compose --version\n\t  docker-compose version 1.26.2, build eefe0d31\n\t  ```\n\n  - Go into the project directory to build and run the container with:\n\n\t  ```\n\t  $ cd mern-app/\n\t  $ docker-compose up --build\n\t  ```\n\n  - Navigate to http://localhost:5000, you should see something like this:\n\n\t  ![mern-app_react_success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/87258255-09924080-c457-11ea-97bd-40ad8784a00b.png)\n\n### Cleaning up the Container and Image\n\n  - To stop the container from running, use `<Ctrl-C>` twice.\n  - To close down the container use the command:\n\n\t  ```\n\t  $ docker-compose down\n\t  ```\n\n  - Then to clean up the container and image which we are no longer using use the command:\n\n\t  ```\n\t  $ docker system prune -fa\n\t  ```\n\n  - Confirm that the container and image is no longer there with:\n\n\t  ```\n\t  $ docker system df -v\n\t  ```\n\n## Previewing the `mern-app` project locally\n\nTo preview the project on your local machine, follow the directions below.\n\n  - Install dependencies for both Express and React:\n\t  ```\n\t  $ cd mern-app/\n\t  $ npm install\n\t  $ cd client/\n\t  $ npm install\n\t  ```\n\n  - To run the React server, use this command in the client directory:\n\n\t  ```\n\t  $ npm start\n\t  ```\n\n  - If you go to http://localhost:3000, you should see something like this:\n\n\t  ![mern-app_react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/87258089-b8358180-c455-11ea-955a-e182e689c993.png)\n\n\t  The API call is not working yet because we have not started the Express server. In another terminal session, run the command \"npm start\" at the root directory of the project.\n\n\t  ![mern-app_run_server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/87258208-ad2f2100-c456-11ea-80c9-7ca9a3624462.png)\n\n\t  Express is now running on port 5000. Switch back to the window with http://localhost:3000 and refresh the page. You should see an updated message at the bottom:\n\n\t  ![mern-app_react_success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/87258255-09924080-c457-11ea-97bd-40ad8784a00b.png)\n\n\t  We now have two servers running: one for the React frontend and one for the Express backend. For this tutorial, however, we only need one server running, so we will run a reverse proxy for React and have Express serve all the content. Stop the React server on port 3000 with Ctrl-C.\n\n  - In the `client` directory run the command:\n\t  ```\n\t  $ npm run-script build\n\t  ```\n\n\t  React will create a production build of your app which serves as an entry point for the static content (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). Now, if you go to http://localhost:5000, you should see the same React page from earlier!\n\n\t  This project currently will only display locally, so in order for anyone on the internet to see it, we will need a remote computer to serve our app.\n\n\t  [Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n\n\t  ___\n\n## Creating an AWS Account\n\nWhy choose AWS?\n\n  - It offers a lot of free services for new accounts.\n  - Very popular among startups and even enterprises.\n  - Customer service support, in our opinion, is a step above the competition.\n  - If you do not have an account, check out this step by step guide by Amazon [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).\n\n\t  Before you provision a new server, it is best practice to make sure your account is as secure as possible by following the prompts on your Security Status checklist. This can be found under the IAM tab from your console's homepage.\n\n\t  ![security_status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/86527279-47d5a180-be52-11ea-97e0-537b62a987b7.png)\n\n\t  ---\n\n## Creating an AWS EC2 Instance\n\nAmazon's EC2 or Elastic Compute Cloud is one of the core products/services AWS provides and is the main building block for many of AWS's other services. It allows users to essentially rent virtual computers on which to run their own applications. You can learn more about EC2 [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud).\n\nStart out by going into the AWS Console and going to the EC2 tab. An easy way to get there is through the Services link at the top and search for EC2 in the prompt.\n\n*We recommend setting your AWS Region to the one closest to you or your intended audience. However, please note that not all AWS Services will be available depending on the region. For our example, we will be working out of the us-east-1 as this region supports all AWS Services.*\n\n---\n\n### _EC2 Console_\n\nYou should see this screen (as of July 2020):\n\n![ec2_console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/86527285-5a4fdb00-be52-11ea-9de2-8ad9dabfd9f3.png)\n\nGo to the **Running Instances** link on the EC2 dashboard and click Launch Instance.\n\n![ec2_running_instances](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/86527322-c8949d80-be52-11ea-9bcb-83ab9a1c8ac6.png)\n\n---\n\n### _AMI_\n\nIn this step, AWS will prompt you to choose an AMI. AMI's are templates to configure new instances. For this tutorial, we will be using Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit (free tier).\n\n![ec2_choose_ami](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/86527338-dba76d80-be52-11ea-834b-f0576918cc40.png)\n\nNext, select the **t2.micro** instance type.\n\n![ec2_choose_instance_type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/86527344-eb26b680-be52-11ea-8636-3c49552b5872.png)\n\nOn the next screen, keep clicking next until you see the option to **Configure Security Group**.\n\n---\n\n### _Security Groups_\n\nSecurity groups are virtual firewalls for your instances.\n\n**Important:** *by default, there is an implicit deny on all ports meaning if you do not add rules, all incoming/outgoing traffic is blocked. Security groups are also stateful, which means setting inbound rules for a certain port will also affect the outbound rules for that port.*\n\nSet your Security Group settings with the following:\n\n![ec2_security_group_configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/87123341-674a4100-c23b-11ea-9216-eb3f7a65f852.png)\n\n*Setting Anywhere on Source for Custom TCP will display a warning flag, but you can ignore that for this tutorial. Ideally, you only want to set known IP addresses.*\n\n| Type         | Port Range | Description.                                |\n| ------------ | :--------: | ------------------------------------------: |\n| SSH          | 22         |  Port for SSH'ing into your server          |\n| HTTP         | 80         |  Port for HTTP requests to your web server  |\n| HTTPS        | 443        |  Port for HTTPS requests to your web server |\n| Custom TCP   | 5000       |  Port which Express will run                |\n| Custom TCP   | 27017      |  Port at which to connect to MongoDB        |\n\nAs you can see with the warning near the bottom of the screen, you do not want to set your *SSH Source IP* as anywhere. This will create a security vulnerability as anyone can try to attempt to log into your server.\n\nTherefore, be sure to set it to your own IP address and any other IP address which may need access to the instance.\n\n---\n\n### _Instance Details_\n\nClick forward to **Review and Launch** to view all configurations of your Instance/AMI.\nIf the configurations look correct go ahead and hit **Launch**.\n\n---\n\n### _Key Pairs_\n\nOnce you launch the instance, AWS will prompt you to create a key pair. A key pair consists of a public key that AWS stores and a private key file that you store. Together they allow you to connect to your instance securely through asymmetrical encryption.\n\nIf this is the first time you are creating a key pair for your project, select **Create a new key pair** from the drop-down and add a name for the key pair.\n\n*Be sure to store the key pair in a secure location. It is generated only once and AWS will not have access to it if you lose it. This is your only means to log into the EC2 instance via SSH.*\n\n![key_pair](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/86527366-0bef0c00-be53-11ea-9f2c-570e3daa3105.png)\n\nOnce you have downloaded the **key pair** make sure to move the **.pem** file to the root directory of your project on your local computer.\n\n![mern-app_root_w_pem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41876764/86527373-17423780-be53-11ea-91fe-fa2a108cc937.png)\n\nNext, check the checkbox acknowledging that you have access to the private key pair and click Launch Instances. This should take you to the Launch Status page.\n\n---\n\n## Accessing your EC2 Instance\n\nClick on the Instances tab on your EC2 console.",

Most people learn AWS by reading a blog or a “[getting started guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)” and referring to the [standard AWS references](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/). Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren’t easy to come by. AWS’s own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn’t include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amazon-web-services) is also not consistently up to date.\n\nThis guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from discussion and editing over beers by [several engineers](AUTHORS.md) who have used AWS extensively.\n\nBefore using the guide, please read the [**license**](#license) and [**disclaimer**](#disclaimer).\n\n[Back to top :arrow_up:](#table-of-contents)\n### Please help!\n\n**This is an early in-progress draft!** It’s our first attempt at assembling this information, so is far from comprehensive still, and likely to have omissions or errors.\n\n[![Slack Chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chat-Slack-ff69b4.svg "Join us. Anyone is welcome!")](http://slackhatesthe.cloud)\n\nPlease help by [**joining the Slack channel**](http://slackhatesthe.cloud) (we like to talk about AWS in general, even if you only have questions — discussion helps the community and guides improvements) and [**contributing to the guide**](CONTRIBUTING.md). This guide is *open to contributions*, so unlike a blog, it can keep improving. Like any open source effort, we combine efforts but also review to ensure high quality.\n\nScope\n-----\n\n-\tCurrently, this guide covers selected “core” services, such as EC2, S3, Load Balancers, EBS, and IAM, and partial details and tips around other services. We expect it to expand.\n-\tIt is not a tutorial, but rather a collection of information you can read and return to.

Private clouds are within a single (usually large) organization. Many companies use a hybrid of private and public clouds.\n\t-\tThe core features of AWS are [infrastructure-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29) (IaaS) — that is, virtual machines and supporting infrastructure. Other cloud service models include [platform-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Platform_as_a_service_.28PaaS.29) (PaaS), which typically are more fully managed services that deploy customers’ applications, or [software-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Software_as_a_service_.28SaaS.29) (SaaS), which are cloud-based applications. AWS does offer a few products that fit into these other models, too.\n\t-\tIn business terms, with infrastructure-as-a-service you have a variable cost model — it is [OpEx, not CapEx](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/what-difference-between-capex-and-opex.asp) (though some [pre-purchased contracts](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/) are still CapEx).\n  - AWS’s TTM revenue was [**$37.549 billion**](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2020/Amazoncom-Announces-First-Quarter/default.aspx) as of Q1 2020 according to their earnings results (slide 14 in the linked deck), or roughly **14%** of Amazon.com’s total revenue (slide 11 in the same deck) for the same TTM period.\n-\t**Main reasons to use AWS:**\n\t-\tIf your company is building systems or products that may need to scale\n\t-\tand you have technical know-how\n\t-\tand you want the most flexible tools\n\t-\tand you’re not significantly tied into different infrastructure already\n\t-\tand you don’t have internal, regulatory, or compliance reasons you can’t use a public cloud-based solution\n\t-\tand you’re not on a Microsoft-first tech stack\n\t-\tand you don’t have a specific reason to use Google Cloud\n\t-\tand you can afford, manage, or negotiate its somewhat higher costs\n\t-\t... then AWS is likely a good option for your company.\n-\tEach of those reasons above might point to situations where other services are preferable. In practice, many, if not most, tech startups as well as a number of modern large companies can or already do benefit from using AWS. Many large enterprises are partly migrating internal infrastructure to Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS.\n-\t**Costs:** Billing and cost management are such big topics that we have [an entire section on this](#billing-and-cost-management).\n-\t🔹**EC2 vs. other services:** Most users of AWS are most familiar with [EC2](#ec2), AWS’ flagship virtual server product, and possibly a few others like S3 and CLBs. But AWS products now extend far beyond basic IaaS, and often companies do not properly understand or appreciate all the many AWS services and how they can be applied, due to the [sharply growing](#which-services-to-use) number of services, their novelty and complexity, branding confusion, and fear of ⛓lock-in to proprietary AWS technology. Although a bit daunting, it’s important for technical decision-makers in companies to understand the breadth of the AWS services and make informed decisions. (We hope this guide will help.)\n-\t🚪**AWS vs. other cloud providers:** While AWS is the dominant IaaS provider (31% market share in [this 2016 estimate](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/aws-remains-dominant-despite-microsoft-and-google-growth-surges)), there is significant competition and alternatives that are better suited to some companies. [This Gartner report](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2G2O5FC&ct=150519&st=sb) has a good overview of the major cloud players :\n\t-\t[**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com/). GCP arrived later to market than AWS, but has vast resources and is now used widely by many companies, including a few large ones. It is gaining market share. Not all AWS services have similar or analogous services in GCP. And vice versa: In particular, GCP offers some more advanced machine learning-based services like the [Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), [Speech](https://cloud.google.com/speech/), and [Natural Language](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) APIs. It’s not common to switch once you’re up and running, but it does happen: [Spotify migrated](http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-cloud-lures-amazon-web-services-customer-spotify-1456270951) from AWS to Google Cloud. There is more discussion [on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-reasons-to-choose-AWS-over-Google-Cloud-or-vice-versa-for-a-high-traffic-web-application) about relative benefits. Of particular note is that VPCs in GCP are [global by default](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/) with subnetworks per region, while AWS’ VPCs have to live within a particular region. This gives GCP an edge if you’re designing applications with geo-replication from the beginning. It’s also possible to [share one GCP VPC](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shared-vpc/) between multiple projects (roughly analogous to AWS accounts), while in AWS you’d have to peer them. It’s also possible to [peer GCP VPCs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc/vpc-peering) in a similar manner to how it’s done in AWS.\n\t-\t[**Microsoft Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en) is the de facto choice for companies and teams that are focused on a Microsoft stack, and it has now placed significant emphasis on Linux as well\n\t-\tIn **China**, AWS’ footprint is relatively small. The market is dominated by Alibaba’s [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/), formerly called [Aliyun](https://intl.aliyun.com/).\n\t-\tCompanies at (very) large scale may want to reduce costs by managing their own infrastructure. For example, [Dropbox migrated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11282948) to their own infrastructure.\n\t-\tOther cloud providers such as [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) offer similar services, sometimes with greater ease of use, more personalized support, or lower cost. However, none of these match the breadth of products, mind-share, and market domination AWS now enjoys.\n\t-\tTraditional managed hosting providers such as [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/) offer cloud solutions as well.\n-\t🚪**AWS vs. PaaS:** If your goal is just to put up a single service that does something relatively simple, and you’re trying to minimize time managing operations engineering, consider a [platform-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The AWS approach to PaaS, Elastic Beanstalk, is arguably more complex, especially for simple use cases.\n-\t🚪**AWS vs. web hosting:** If your main goal is to host a website or blog, and you don’t expect to be building an app or more complex service, you may wish consider one of the myriad [web hosting services](https://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting).\n-\t🚪**AWS vs. managed hosting:** Traditionally, many companies pay [managed hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service) providers to maintain physical servers for them, then build and deploy their software on top of the rented hardware. This makes sense for businesses who want direct control over hardware, due to legacy, performance, or special compliance constraints, but is usually considered old fashioned or unnecessary by many developer-centric startups and younger tech companies.\n-\t**Complexity:** AWS will let you build and scale systems to the size of the largest companies, but the complexity of the services when used at scale requires significant depth of knowledge and experience. Even very simple use cases often require more knowledge to do “right” in AWS than in a simpler environment like Heroku or Digital Ocean. (This guide may help!)\n-\t**Geographic locations:** AWS has data centers in [over a dozen geographic locations](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions), known as **regions**, in Europe, East Asia, North and South America, and now Australia and India. It also has many more **edge locations** globally for reduced latency of services like CloudFront.\n\t-\tSee the [current list](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/) of regions and edge locations, including upcoming ones.\n\t-\tIf your infrastructure needs to be in close physical proximity to another service for latency or throughput reasons (for example, latency to an ad exchange), viability of AWS may depend on the location.\n-\t⛓**Lock-in:** As you use AWS, it’s important to be aware when you are depending on AWS services that do not have equivalents elsewhere.\n\t-\tLock-in may be completely fine for your company, or a significant risk. It’s important from a business perspective to make this choice explicitly, and consider the cost, operational, business continuity, and competitive risks of being tied to AWS. AWS is such a dominant and reliable vendor, many companies are comfortable with using AWS to its full extent. Others can tell stories about the [dangers of “cloud jail” when costs spiral](http://firstround.com/review/the-three-infrastructure-mistakes-your-company-must-not-make/).\n\t-\tGenerally, the more AWS services you use, the more lock-in you have to AWS — that is, the more engineering resources (time and money) it will take to change to other providers in the future.\n\t-\tBasic services like virtual servers and standard databases are usually easy to migrate to other providers or on premises. Others like load balancers and IAM are specific to AWS but have close equivalents from other providers. The key thing to consider is whether engineers are architecting systems around specific AWS services that are not open source or relatively interchangeable. For example, Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis, Redshift, and DynamoDB do not have substantially equivalent open source or commercial service equivalents, while EC2, RDS (MySQL or Postgres), EMR, and ElastiCache more or less do. (See more [below](#which-services-to-use), where these are noted with ⛓.)\n-\t**Combining AWS and other cloud providers:** Many customers combine AWS with other non-AWS services. For example, legacy systems or secure data might be in a managed hosting provider, while other systems are AWS. Or a company might only use S3 with another provider doing everything else. However small startups or projects starting fresh will typically stick to AWS or Google Cloud only.\n-\t**Hybrid cloud:** In larger enterprises, it is common to have [hybrid deployments](https://aws.amazon.com/enterprise/hybrid/) encompassing private cloud or on-premises servers and AWS — or other enterprise cloud providers like [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/solutions/hybrid-cloud)/[Bluemix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/hybrid/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/hybrid-cloud)/[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/), [NetApp](http://www.netapp.com/us/solutions/cloud/hybrid-cloud/), or [EMC](http://www.emc.com/en-us/cloud/hybrid-cloud-computing/index.htm).\n-\t**Major customers:** Who uses AWS and Google Cloud?\n\t-\tAWS’s [list of customers](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/) includes large numbers of mainstream online properties and major brands, such as Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify (moving to Google Cloud), Airbnb, Expedia, Yelp, Zynga, Comcast, Nokia, and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\t-\tAzure’s [list of customers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/case-studies/) includes companies such as NBC Universal, 3M and Honeywell Inc.\n\t-\tGoogle Cloud’s [list of customers](https://cloud.google.com/customers/) is large as well, and includes a few mainstream sites, such as [Snapchat](http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-is-built-on-googles-cloud-2014-1), Best Buy, Domino’s, and Sony Music.\n\n[Back to top :arrow_up:](#table-of-contents)\n### Which Services to Use\n\n-\tAWS offers a *lot* of different services — [about a hundred](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) at last count.\n-\tMost customers use a few services heavily, a few services lightly, and the rest not at all. What services you’ll use depends on your use cases. Choices differ substantially from company to company.\n-\t**Immature and unpopular services:** Just because AWS has a service that sounds promising, it doesn’t mean you should use it. Some services are very narrow in use case, not mature, are overly opinionated, or have limitations, so building your own solution may be better. We try to give a sense for this by breaking products into categories.\n-\t**Must-know infrastructure:** Most typical small to medium-size users will focus on the following services first. If you manage use of AWS systems, you likely need to know at least a little about all of these. (Even if you don’t use them, you should learn enough to make that choice intelligently.)\n\t-\t[IAM](#security-and-iam): User accounts and identities (you need to think about accounts early on!)\n\t-\t[EC2](#ec2): Virtual servers and associated components, including:\n\t\t-\t[AMIs](#amis): Machine Images\n\t\t-\t[Load Balancers](#load-balancers): CLBs and ALBs\n\t\t-\t[Autoscaling](#auto-scaling): Capacity scaling (adding and removing servers based on load)\n\t\t-\t[EBS](#ebs): Network-attached disks\n\t\t-\t[Elastic IPs](#elastic-ips): Assigned IP addresses\n\t-\t[S3](#s3): Storage of files\n\t-\t[Route 53](#route-53): DNS and domain registration\n\t-\t[VPC](#vpcs-network-security-and-security-groups): Virtual networking, network security, and co-location; you automatically use\n\t-\t[CloudFront](#cloudfront): CDN for hosting content\n\t-\t[CloudWatch](#cloudwatch): Alerts, paging, monitoring\n-\t**Managed services:** Existing software solutions you could run on your own, but with managed deployment:\n\t-\t[RDS](#rds): Managed relational databases (managed MySQL, Postgres, and Amazon’s own Aurora database)\n\t-\t[EMR](#emr): Managed Hadoop\n\t-\t[Elasticsearch](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/): Managed Elasticsearch\n\t-\t[ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/): Managed Redis and Memcached\n-\t**Optional but important infrastructure:** These are key and useful infrastructure components that are less widely known and used.

      "# Setting up a ReactJS Application on AWS EC2\n\nSetting up a web application on an AWS EC2 instance involves several steps, from launching the server to configuring Nginx to serve your application. In this guide, we’ll walk through each step to deploy a ReactJS application on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu server.\n![1i (3)](https://github.com/codewithmuh/react-aws-ec2-nginx/assets/51082957/19ac2fc1-648f-4bed-9835-4bb653c0904a)\n\n## Table of Contents:\n\n1.

[Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n### Complete YouTube Video Tutorial:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UK_OVKDRArs?si=G620QaGNjJOA0LGR\n\n### Step 1: Launch an AWS EC2 Ubuntu Server\n\n- Log in to the AWS Management Console.\n- Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.\n- Click on “Launch Instance” and choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with your preferred OS.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting to the EC2 Instance\n\n- Use your preferred SSH terminal to connect to the EC2 instance.\n  - For example, if you’re on a Mac, you can use the Terminal app.\n\n### Step 3: Installing Node.js, NPM, and Nginx\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update -y\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt install -y nodejs\nsudo apt install npm -y\nsudo apt install nginx -y\n```\n### Step 4: Cloning ReactJS App to EC2\n\n- For Public Repository:\n  ```bash\n  git clone <YOUR-GIT-Repo>\n  ```\n- For Private Repository:\n  ```bash\n  git clone <YOUR-GIT-Repo>\n  ```\n\nit will ask you for your GitHub username and password. You can use a Personal Access Token instead of a password.  \n\n### Step 5: Install all the required dependencies\n  ```bash\n  cd <project-folder>\n  npm install\n  ```\n### Step 6: Create Production Build\n  ```bash\n  npm run build\n  sudo mkdir /var/www/vhosts/frontend/\n  sudo cp -R build/ /var/www/vhosts/frontend/\n  ```\n### Step 7: Create Nginx File\nwith this command, you can check if already a default nginx file exists. You have to remove it.\n\n\n```bash\ncd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\nsudo rm -rf default\n```\n\n- Create a configuration file for Nginx using the following command:\n  ```bash\n  sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/<nginx-file-name>\n  ```\n\n- Paste the provided server configuration inside the file created.\n\n  ```bash\n  server {\n    listen 80 default_server;\n    server_name _;\n\n    location / {\n        autoindex on;\n        root /var/www/vhosts/frontend/build;\n        try_files $uri /index.html;\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n  \n- Activate the configuration using the following command:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<nginx-file-name> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n  ```\n### Step 8: Start the Application\n- Restart Nginx and allow the changes to take place.\n  ```bash\n  sudo systemctl restart nginx\n  sudo service nginx restart\n  ```\n- Additionally, in case of errors, you can check error logs and status.\n### Step 9: Domain and SSL setup\n**Domain**\n\nFirst, you have to Public IP address or ec2 instance as An R3cord of your domain, it can be on any domain provider like GoDaddy. You can also watch the video.\n\n**SSL Setup**\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx\n  sudo certbot --nginx -d <domain-name>\n  sudo systemctl reload nginx\n  ```\n### Step 10: Conclusion\nDeploying a ReactJS application on an AWS EC2 instance requires careful configuration and setup. By following these steps, you can successfully launch your application and serve it using Nginx, ensuring a seamless user experience.",
